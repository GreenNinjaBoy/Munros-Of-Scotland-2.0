# Munro Baggers 2.0

## This is the second iteration of my Munro Baggers website that was creatred as part of my Code Institute Milestone 1 project. The aim of recreating the site was to take on board the feedback I recieved from my first attempt and to create a more polished version. This was also a great opportunity to improve my skills in HTML and CSS.

This website is designed for those interested in joining a walking club to explore Scotland's "Munros" mountains. Visitors can discover a brief history of these peaks, learn about the benefits of regular walking, and watch a motivational video on the homepage. The Gallery page showcases various images of the stunning Scottish countryside where these mountains are located. Additionally, the Equipment page provides essential information on gear and preparation needed for a Munro walk. Users can also subscribe to a monthly newsletter via the sign-up page to stay informed about upcoming events. This site aims to foster a community of both new and seasoned hillwalkers eager to explore Scotland's Munros.

The Live link can be found [here](insert link here)

### Header and Navigation Bar

The header and the navigation bar have been altered from the original submitted project [Munro Baggers](insert link here).
It was noted on my assessment feedback that my navigationbar did not render well on mobile devices and that when displaying on a smaller device the items then were split into two rows. The assessor suggested that i should have introduced a hamburger menu to fix this issue however at that time i didn't know how to do this and it was not covered in the inital stages of ther course.

Since reviewing my feedback I have used flexbox to create a more responsive navigation bar that will display correctly on all devices with the addition of a hover effect.
I still haven't added a hamburger menu but this is something i will look into in the future. I have also inserted an event section into the navigation bar to allow users to find out about any upcoming events.

Please see below for the before and after images of the navigation bar.

As you can see from the images above, the navigation links are more spread out and are now more visible with the addition of the event section. The text is also more visible and easier to read.

## Gallery Page

The gallery page has been updated from the inital submitted project. The original gallery page was a collage of images all on the one page. This was not very user friendly and made it difficult for users to view the images in a linear way. The new gallery page has been updated to use a carousel to display the images in a linear way. This is more user friendly and allows users to view the images in a more linear way.

Given that this webpage is focused on HTML and CSS i was able to achieve the carousel effect with the use or radio buttons and labels to control the images.

Please see below for the before and after images of the gallery page.

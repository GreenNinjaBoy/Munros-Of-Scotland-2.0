            <h2>What is a Munro?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Munros are mountains in the country of Scotland with a height of over 3000 feet.
                You can 'bag' a munro by climbing it and recording it on a map.
                The offical list of these mountains comes to a total of 283.

            <h2>Why are they called Munros?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Munros are named after Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet (1856â€“1919), who produced the first list of such
                hills, known as
                Munro's Tables, in 1891.
                Sir Hugh also added what he considered lesser peaks now known today as 'Munro-Tops' which are also
                over
                3000 feet but lower than the nearby primary mountain.
                As off December 2020 the total number of Munros are 282 with 226 Munro-tops.

        <!--Brief description on title given to someone who has bagged all 283 munros-->
        <div>
            <h2>Compleater</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The title of 'compleater' is given to someone who has bagged all 283 munros.
                This is a great achievement and a great way to show off your skills.
                The firt person to do so was Rev A E Robertson in 1901.
                Sadly Sir Himself passed away with only 3 munro left to bag.
